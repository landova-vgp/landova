      <h3>📍 Thiruporur – Fast-Growing Real Estate Hotspot</h3>
      <p>Located ~48 km south of Chennai along the Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR), Thiruporur is evolving from a quiet panchayat town into a promising investment destination.</p>

      <p><strong>🚧 What’s driving the growth?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>🔹 Strategic connectivity: </strong> Sandwiched between Kelambakkam and Alathur and just off OMR, it provides easy access to major IT hubs like Siruseri and Sholinganallur, making it ideal for tech professionals.</li>
        <li><strong>🔹 Infrastructure momentum: </strong>The 7.5 km Thiruporur bypass (six-lane) is now largely operational, easing congestion and improving movement along OMR and access to the coastal ECR.</li>
        <li><strong>🔹 Upcoming amenities: </strong> The proposed Chennai peripheral road and nearby attractions like the 62‑acre Wonderla theme park (slated to open in 2025) are set to boost local demand.</li>
        <li><strong>🔹 Metro on the horizon: </strong> Metro Phase II extension will eventually connect OMR suburbs like Navalur and Siruseri (in Thiruporur taluk), which is expected to positively impact property rates.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>📈 Real Estate Scene:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>🔹 Plots & apartments: </strong>A mix of ready-to-move apartments and plotted developments are emerging. Price trends: from ~₹2,400–3,000/sq ft a few years ago to ₹3,100–4,000/sq ft now ().</li>
        <li><strong>🔹 Developer focus: </strong>Builders like DivyaSree, Casagrand, Vijay Raja, Adityaram are actively launching projects spanning villas, apartments, and plots—from ₹15 L to ₹1 Cr+.</li>
        <li><strong>🔹 Market sentiment: </strong>Investors see Thiruporur as a top-10 land investment area in Chennai, citing OMR Metro, rise in residential demand, and future infrastructure ().</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>🌱 Emerging Challenges:</strong></p>
      <p>Long-term residents note growing pains: patchy sewage systems, incomplete drainage, and traffic during temple events  ￼. Public transport is still evolving.</p>

      <p><strong>📝 Summary</strong></p>
      <p>Thiruporur is transitioning fast—from farmland to a suburban extension supporting Chennai’s booming tech-driven sprawl. Its appeal lies in urban connectivity, improving roads, Metro prospects, and organized new projects. While infrastructure still plays catch-up, the growth trajectory suggests property values are likely to keep climbing—making it a compelling spot for both end-users and investors.</p>
